# Package BuildEnvs

Package environments provided by `buildEnv`.
They exist to collect packages into larger bundles that go in profiles.

My primary use to to create standalone collections of my wrapped programs.
I can freely update these without having to do full system builds.
Useful in the case of doing things like minor application tweaks and not disrupting servers.
