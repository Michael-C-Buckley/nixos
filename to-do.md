# Some things I am reminding myself I want to work on

- Setup up caching/remote building
- Module import structure
- Finish style consistency of pointers and themes
- Nebula networking

## Restructuring

- Remove files for my user configs
- Integrate *some* Nix management of specific dots

## In Progress

- Nix Cache (Attic)

This was started but paused due to time constraints.

Still needs:

- TLS
- Push mechanism
