# Package Lists

Simple mechanism for easily portable lists of packages that I commonly use. They are lists of strings that match the nixpkgs derivation names they represent. Later, when the pkgs is instantiated are the derivation values realized. See `modules/lib/packageLists.nix` for those functions.
