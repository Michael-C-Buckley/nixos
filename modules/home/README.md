# Home-manager

Basically hosts I'm using this for are various WSL instances I run at work.
They might appear or disappear at random and are liable for huge shifts.
I'm experimenting with my workflow.

## Why not NixOS-WSL?

I have used it for a long time, but run into some workflow and compatibility issues.
As such, I'm looking to find something that works well for my needs.
